# homebridge-people-guest-mode

## What This Plugin Is
This is a plugin for [homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge). It's a forked version of [homebridge-people](https://github.com/PeteLawrence/homebridge-people) with a dummy switch called "Guest Mode" designed to override the "Anyone" presence sensor so that you can force presence without onboarding a new person.

## Installation

Before installing this plugin, you should install Homebridge using the [official instructions](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge/wiki).

### Install via Homebridge Config UI X

1. Search for `Homebridge People Guest Mode` on the Plugins tab of [Config UI X](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-config-ui-x).
2. Install the `Homebridge People Guest Mode` plugin and use the form to enter your configuration.

### Manual Installation
